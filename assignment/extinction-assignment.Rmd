## Background

- [Section Intro Video](https://youtu.be/QsH6ytm89GI)
- [Ceballos et al (2015)](http://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.1400253)

Our focal task will be to reproduce the result from Ceballos and colleagues showing the recent increase in extinction rates relative to the background rate:

## Coding Part

Let's start with downloading the data we need.
```{r}
base_url <- "https://apiv3.iucnredlist.org"
endpoint <- "/api/v3/species/page/"
page_number <- 0
args <- "?token="
token <- "9bb4facb6d23f48efbf424bb05c0c1ef1cf6f468393bc745d42179ac4aca5fee"
query <- paste0(base_url, endpoint, page_number, args, token)
```

```{r}
resp <- GET("https://apiv3.iucnredlist.org/api/v3/species/page/")
resp
```
```{r}
txt <- content(resp,as = "parsed")
```

```{r}
base_url <- "https://apiv3.iucnredlist.org"
endpoint <- "/api/v3/species/page/"
page_number <- 0:12
args <- "?token="
token <- "9bb4facb6d23f48efbf424bb05c0c1ef1cf6f468393bc745d42179ac4aca5fee"
queries <- paste0(base_url, endpoint, page_number, args, token)
```

```{r}
resp <- map(queries, GET)
```

```{r}
status <- map_int(resp, status_code)
good <- resp[status==200]
try_again <- map(queries[status != 200], GET)
good <- c(good, try_again)
```

Then, we need to rectangle the full species list:
```{r}

txts <- map(good, content, as = "parsed")
```

```{r}
rectangle_me <- function(x) as_tibble(compact(x))
stack_txt <- function(txt) map_dfr(txt$result, rectangle_me)
all_sci_names <- purrr::map_dfr(txts,stack_txt)
all_sci_names
```

We need to filter the category to get the extinct species and arrange it by scientific_name.
```{r}
extinct <- all_sci_names %>% filter(category == "EX") %>% arrange(scientific_name)
extinct
```

Here's a quick example to see how we can extract the approximate extinction date from the data:
```{r}
name <- extinct$scientific_name[[919]]
url <- paste0(base_url, "/api/v3/species/narrative/", name, args, token)

x <- url %>% GET() %>% content()
#Dig inside the reslut object. There's a line of text saying it was last discovered in 1990s. However, it's not the style we want. We need regular expression!

rationale <- x$result[[1]]$rationale
# How to parse this text to get the date?
rationale
```

To do that, we need to import the stringr library to enable the usage of regular expression.
```{r}
library(stringr)
stringr::str_extract(rationale,"\\d+")
```

We then need this new data.
```{r}
if (!file.exists("resp2.rds")) {
  resp2 <- map(url[1:20], get2)
  saveRDS(resp2, "resp2.rds")
}
resp2 <- readRDS("resp2.rds")

```

We need to generate a dataframe that has one column for scientific_name and one column for rationale using the method illustrated above.
```{r}
status <- map_int(resp2, status_code)
all(status == 200)

narrative <- map(resp2, content)
names <- map(narrative, "name")
missing <- map_lgl(names, is.null)

good_names <- names[!missing]
good_narrative <- narrative[!missing]

result <- map(good_narrative, "result")
result1 <- map(result, function(x) x[[1]])
rationale <- map(result1, "rationale")
missing_rationale <- map_lgl(rationale, is.null)

complete_narrative <- good_narrative[!missing_rationale]
complete_rationale <- rationale[!missing_rationale]
complete_names <- good_names[!missing_rationale]
narrative_df <- tibble(scientific_name = as.character(complete_names),
                       rationale = as.character(complete_rationale))
narrative_df
```

Then, we need to combine the narrative_df and the extinct dataframe we have earlier and add one more column "century" for future use.
```{r}
mutated <- narrative_df %>% 
  left_join(extinct) %>% 
  mutate(date = stringr::str_extract(rationale, "\\d{4}"),century = stringr::str_extract(date, "\\d{2}"))
mutated
```

We would then do group_by classname first and century next to get the number of species that went extinct in each century.
```{r}
combined <- mutated %>%
  group_by(class_name,century) %>% 
  summarise(extinct = n())
combined
```

The final steps is to calculate the extinction rate! We need to get the cumulative extinction number and the total species number.  
```{r}
cumulative_extinction <- combined %>% 
  arrange(class_name,century) %>%
  mutate(cumulative_extinction = cumsum(extinct))
cumulative_extinction
```
To get the total species number, we need a new method called "count."
```{r}
count <- all_sci_names %>% 
  count(class_name)
count
```

We need to join the two tables to appraoch our final result.
```{r}
final_result1 <- cumulative_extinction %>%
  inner_join(count)
final_result1
```

Here is the final result table! To make our final graph more readable, we decide to choose classes that are more representative. 
```{r}
final_result2 <- final_result1 %>% 
  mutate(cumulative_extinction_rate = cumulative_extinction/n) %>%
  filter(century %in% 15:21) %>%
  filter(class_name == 'ACTINOPTERYGII'|class_name == 'AVES'|class_name =='INSECTA'|class_name =='MAMMALIA'|class_name =='REPTILIA')
final_result2
```

The last step is to generate the graph. 
```{r}
final_result2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = century,y = cumulative_extinction_rate,group=class_name,color=class_name)) + 
  geom_line()
```

## Analysis Part

_Are we experiencing the sixth great extinction?_  

What is the current pace of extinction? Is it accelerating? How does it compare to background extinction rates?

According to the graph, “AVES” represents birds, “ACTINOPTERYGII” represents fish, “INSECTA” represents insects, “MAMMALIA” represents mammals, and “REPTILIA” represents reptiles. The cumulative extinction rate started accelerating significantly from the 17th century for birds and mammals. Due to lack of data, we can only observe the extinction rate for fish and insects from 18 to 20 century, but the cumulative extinction is apparently increasing. For reptiles, the cumulative extinction rate is gradually increasing as well. 

Compared to the graph by Ceballos et al., our cumulative rate of extinction smoothed from 19 century to 20 century. However, the graph by Ceballos et al. shows that the rate is increasing in this period of time. This could be due to missing data in our sample and missing/different categories of animals. 

From our observation, we are on the way towards the sixth great extinction because the cumulative rate of extinction is accelerating at an unprecedented pace. While palaeontologists characterize mass extinctions as times when the Earth loses more than three-quarters of its species in a geologically short interval, we think we could potentially lead to the sixth great extinction without proper species management. Barnosky confirmed in his paper that "current extinction rates are higher than would be expected from the fossil record, highlighting the need for effective conservation measures."
